# Changelog

All notable changes to shipyard, named release-lanes before 0.3.0. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). shipyard releases itself with its own
bot.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `changelog_guard.py move` carries each entry a rebase dropped into a released section
  under its own `###` heading in Unreleased, creating the heading in Keep a Changelog
  order, and leaves the released section as the base has it; it no longer leaves a bullet
  with no heading. `check` also fails on such a headless bullet and on a duplicate heading
  under Unreleased, and `union` keeps a blank line between a release heading and the
  heading it meets. The landing loop runs `move`, `check`, and the planner's dry run after
  every rebase, and prints the Unreleased section for the lander to read (#25)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- "Where the agents run" in the README, and a last hand-over step in `shipyard-setup`
  that asks whether the skills run on demand, on a `/loop`, or as a cloud `/schedule`
  routine, and whether a routine may merge

### Changed

- The `release-lanes-setup` skill is now `shipyard-setup`: `/shipyard-setup` (or
  `/shipyard:shipyard-setup` from the plugin) replaces `/release-lanes-setup`. A checkout
  linked into `~/.agents/skills` re-runs the link loop from the README and removes the
  dangling `release-lanes-setup` link. "Set up release lanes" and "add a release bot"
  still find it

### Fixed

- The design gate finds an open decisions PR by the log file it changes, not by
  `DECISIONS` in its title, which missed a PR titled "Record D-1 and D-2"
- `triage_state.py` pages past the caps of its GitHub query instead of reading a capped
  list as complete: open issues beyond the newest 100, an issue's comments beyond the
  newest 50 (an older verdict or "On hold" line), cross-references beyond the oldest 50
  (a later linked PR), and tags back to the newest stable one. An issue with more than 100
  labels exits 2 as bad input. A repo under the caps still takes one query (#19)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- `doctor`'s `work branch` check asks origin for a `shipyard` branch, as `prepare` does,
  instead of reading the clone's fetched refs: a shallow or single-branch clone (such as a
  CI checkout) passed while origin had the branch, and a stale `origin/shipyard` failed
  after it was deleted. It warns when there is no origin or origin can't be reached

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- A scheduled or hand-started run of the prepare workflow no longer cancels a push run
  waiting out `quiet_minutes`: only a newer push shares the settle job's concurrency
  group, and any other run gets a group of its own (#6)
- `prepare` names a branch `shipyard` on origin that blocks the `shipyard/<tag>` work
  branch, instead of failing with git's raw `cannot lock ref` error, and `doctor` checks
  for it as `work branch` (#7)
- `github-pr-triage` launches reviewer agents from the repo's root and has each confirm
  its remote: from a nested clone, worktree isolation copied the wrong repository and a
  reviewer's fix commits were lost with its worktree
- `triage_state.py` reads an issue's newest triage comment, not its oldest, so a
  re-decision changes NEEDS_PR and clears REVISIT. It compares comment and tag times as
  instants, so a tag date with a UTC offset no longer misorders against a comment's `Z`
  time
- The triage skills record a pass's decisions in one docs PR opened before dispatch, not
  in each implementing PR: decision ids are sequential, so two PRs that each added an
  entry both took the same `D-n`. github-pr-triage renumbers a colliding entry when it
  lands a batch

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- A design gate and a decisions log for the triage skills. An issue that changes a flag,
  a format, a default, a public API, or stored state gets its design written into the
  issue and checked against the repo's settled decisions before an implementer starts;
  a departure waits for the user. `decisions.py` keeps the log (`DECISIONS.md` or
  `docs/decisions.md`): `add` numbers and links entries, `find` lists the rules a diff's
  paths touch, `check` validates it. Implementer and reviewer briefs carry the matching
  rules, and github-pr-triage holds a PR that departs from one

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- The `github-ship-watch` skill: one pass reports a failed or stalled release bot, a
  release missing from PyPI, fixed issues not yet told which version shipped them, and
  issues triage owes, then finishes what the policy already decided. Its
  `watch_state.py` exits 1 when anything needs action, for `/loop` and `/schedule`

### Fixed

- `shipped.py` fetches tags with `--force`, so it no longer fails once the bot has moved
  a major tag such as `v0`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- `github-pr-triage` starts a shipyard bot by naming the lane: a hand-started
  `lane=policy` run cancels the push run's quiet wait and then skips (#6)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-03

### Breaking

- release-lanes is now shipyard: the package, the CLI (`shipyard init`, `shipyard doctor`,
  and the rest), and the repository `romamo/shipyard`. In a repository already set up,
  replace `romamo/release-lanes` with `romamo/shipyard` in `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
  or run `shipyard init --force` and restore your policy. A release commit now waits on a
  `shipyard/` work branch

### Added

- The GitHub workflow skills join `release-lanes-setup`: `github-issue-triage`,
  `github-issue-resolve`, and `github-pr-triage`, with the whole flow in `docs/flow.md`.
  `github-pr-triage` starts a shipyard bot after its last merge
- A Claude Code plugin and marketplace in `.claude-plugin`: `/plugin marketplace add
  romamo/shipyard`, then `/plugin install shipyard@shipyard`. Each release sets the
  plugin's version

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- A rejected push now reports git's error, and a rejected tag push is retried: the first
  release by the bot (0.2.0) landed on main, but its tag push was refused and the
  reason was lost. The `land` step also fails when the tool fails, where a pipe through
  `tee` hid the failure and reported success

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- `doctor` fails a `[tool.uv.sources]` entry taken from a local path or installed
  editable, and the setup skill covers a Python package's build and smoke test

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Release lanes driven by a hand-written CHANGELOG: `dev` and `rc` pre-releases cut from
  main without touching it, `stable` releases promoted from an rc that soaked without a
  blocker, and `hotfix` releases of chosen pull requests from `release/X.Y`
- Triggers per lane (quiet time after merges, schedule windows in any time zone, a finished
  milestone) and gates (a `release-blocker` label, freeze windows); every lane can be
  started by hand
- Version bumps from the pending entries' headings or from the paths changed since the last
  stable tag
- Reusable `prepare.yml` and `land.yml` workflows that run the caller's CI on the release
  commit before tagging, then sync a stable release made off main back into main
- `init` and `doctor` commands, and a setup skill for agents
