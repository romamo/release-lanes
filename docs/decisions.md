# Decisions

Rules the maintainers settled, numbered in order. Triage designs and code reviews check
every change against the entries whose "Applies to" it touches. Change a rule by adding an
entry that supersedes it, never by editing an old one.

## D-1: Only a push cancels the settle wait; lane=policy follows the policy

- Decided: 2026-10-04, in romamo/shipyard#6
- Rule: The settle job's cancelling concurrency group is shared by push runs only, and a hand-started lane=policy run evaluates triggers exactly as a scheduled run does (quiet is never due by hand)
- Why: A dispatch or cron run cancelled a push run's quiet wait and then skipped; making lane=policy count quiet as due would change its meaning and make local shipyard plan previews report quiet as due. Ending a batch by hand means starting the lane
- Applies to: .github/workflows/prepare.yml, src/shipyard/planner.py, workflow_dispatch lane input
- Enforced by: tests/test_workflows.py; review for the planner
